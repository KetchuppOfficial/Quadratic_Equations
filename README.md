# Quadratic_Equations

This project is developed to solve quadratic equations. In maths equation is called quadratic if it can be arranged in standart form as ![equation](ax^2 + bx + c = 0) where "a" is not equal to 0. If you run the program, you can solve any equation that not only can be arranged in standart form as ![equation](ax^2 + bx + c = 0) but also coefficient "a" can be equal to 0.

## How to run 

```
$ make
$ make run
```

If you also want to delete all objective files and the executable file:

```
$ make clean
```

## The project in action
